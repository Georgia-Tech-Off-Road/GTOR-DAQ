# How to use this folder:
First off, thank you for actually reading the README.md! The layout for the conversion libraries is simple. ConversionFunctions.h contains ONLY the #include preprocessor commands to each header file. This allows for easy and convenient import into ../ProcessingPrograms/DataTranslator.cpp. Each sensor conversion function should have its own directory following the general naming conventions currently seen. Inside each SensorName directory should be SensorNameConvert.cpp and SensorNameConvert.cpp. SensorNameConvert.cpp should #include SensorNameConvert.h and other relevant files.
