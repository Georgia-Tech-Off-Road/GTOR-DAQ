# Overview
Welcome to DAQ's implementation of our Commboard Transmission Library ("[CMBTL](https://github.com/Georgia-Tech-Off-Road/CommboardTransmissionLibrary)"). This library contains all of the code that defines our current sensor setup for compression, encoding, and decoding to binary and JSON formats. For more information on CMBT, please refer to the documentation for that [library](https://github.com/Georgia-Tech-Off-Road/CommboardTransmissionLibrary). .Naturally, this library is also a proof of concept and testing ground for our larger infrastructure defined in CMBTL. You will find unit tests in ``Testing/`` and an example in ``examples/SimpleCommunication``. This library is a dependency of CommboardTransmissionLibary and *its* dependencies. If you wish to test locally, you will have to download those, however, we perform this testing in our [main repository](https://github.com/Georgia-Tech-Off-Road/GTOR-DAQ). CMBTL and this library are designed for Arduino, but also come with CMakeLists.txt for testing and other purposes. Please let us know if you have any questions, we would be glad to help.
